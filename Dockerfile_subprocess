# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's code into the container at /app
# This assumes the bot script is named bot.py and is in the same directory as the Dockerfile
# Adjust if the main script has a different name or is in a subdirectory.
COPY . .

# Expose a volume for downloads (but good for persisting data)
# The bot script currently uses "video_downloads/" relative to its execution path.
# So, /app/video_downloads/ will be the path inside the container.
VOLUME /app/video_downloads

# Expose a volume for cookies (for easier management)
VOLUME /app/cookies

# Command to run the application
# CMD ["python", "bot_subprocess.py"]
CMD ["python", "bot_telethon.py"]
